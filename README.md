## Design Features

- Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and tablet screens
- Organized Codebase: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity
- Collapsible sidebar navigation
- Consistent Branding: Interface styled according to Amrita Universityâ€™s theme.
- Interactive Components: Collapsible sidebar, navigation menus, and input forms.
- Intuitive form interfaces
- Clean & Modern UI: Redesigned layout with improved accessibility.

## ðŸ”— Future Scope
- The frontend is structured to allow **easy backend integration**.  
- Since most dynamic interactions (form handling, data placeholders, validation) are already handled in JavaScript,  
  backend APIs or a database can be connected with minimal changes.  
- This makes the project extendable into a full-fledged **web application** in the future.
